# Planning Heuristic Analysis

The results are compared based on time complexity, space complexity, and optimality which are 3 out of 4 measures pointed out in [1]. Clock time is used as a proxy for time complexity and space complexity is measured by the number of explored and evaluated nodes.
 
### Optimal plans
Problem 1
```
Load(C1, P1, SFO)
Fly(P1, SFO, JFK)
Unload(C1, P1, JFK)
Load(C2, P2, JFK)
Fly(P2, JFK, SFO)
Unload(C2, P2, SFO
```

Problem 2
```
Load(C1, P1, SFO)
Load(C2, P2, JFK)
Load(C3, P3, ATL)
Fly(P2, JFK, SFO)
Unload(C2, P2, SFO)
Fly(P1, SFO, JFK)
Unload(C1, P1, JFK)
Fly(P3, ATL, SFO)
Unload(C3, P3, SFO)
```

Problem 3
```
Load(C1, P1, SFO)
Fly(P1, SFO, ATL)
Load(C3, P1, ATL)
Fly(P1, ATL, JFK)
Unload(C1, P1, JFK)
Unload(C3, P1, JFK)
Load(C2, P2, JFK)
Fly(P2, JFK, ORD)
Load(C4, P2, ORD)
Fly(P2, ORD, SFO)
Unload(C2, P2, SFO)
Unload(C4, P2, SFO)
```

### No heuristics
Problem | Algorithm | Expansion | Goals | New Nodes | Time | Optimal
---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----
P1 | DFS | 21 | 22 | 85 | 0.02 | False
P1 | BFS | 43 | 56 | 180 | 0.03 | True
P1 | UCS | 55 | 57 | 224 | 0.04 | True
P2 | DFS | 624 | 625 | 5602 | 3.5 | False
P2 | BFS | 3343 | 4609 | 30509 | 13 | True
P2 | UCS | 4840 | 4842 | 43918 | 44 | True
P3 | DFS | 408 | 409 | 3364 | 1.7 | False
P3 | BFS | 14663 | 18098 | 129631 | 97 | True
P3 | UCS | 16963 | 16965 | 149136 | 3.7e+02 | True

Across all problems DFS is the fastest (time complexity) but is not resulting in optimal results. BFS is resulting in less expansions and new nodes relative to UCS and it is faster so it's superior to UCS.

BFS is more appropriate for trees that are not very wide since this will result in inefficient memory usage[2], [3]. Time and memory complexity for BFS is O(b^d) were b is the branching factor and d the depth of the most shallow solution. For very deep trees DFS becomes impractical and it's not complete in the tree version[4], [5]. 

### Using heuristics
Problem | Algorithm | Expansion | Goals | New Nodes | Time | Optimal
---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----
P1 | A* with h1 | 55 | 57 | 224 | 0.04 | True
P1 | A* ignore precond | 41 | 43 | 170 | 0.04 | True
P1 | A* pg levelsum | 11 | 13 | 50 | 2.3 | True
P2 | A* ignore precond | 1504 | 1506 | 13800 | 13 | True
P2 | A* with h1 | 4840 | 4842 | 43918 | 42 | True
P2 | A* pg levelsum | 85 | 87 | 831 | 2.8e+02 | True
P3 | A* ignore precond | 4723 | 4725 | 41835 | 84 | True
P3 | A* with h1 | 16963 | 16965 | 149136 | 3.8e+02 | True
P3 | A* pg levelsum | 378 | 380 | 3461 | 1.8e+03 | False

All solutions except for levelsum for problem 3 are optimal. Levelsum also has the highest time complexity but the lowest space complexity. h1 has the highest space complexity that really degrades with a depth of 12 in problem 3. Ignore preconditions seems to be a happy medium with much less time complexity as the depth increases and a relatively reasonable usage of space.  

### Conclusions
Overall the use of heuristics is helpful with both time and space complexity as evident from the results. However a single heuristics is not appropriate for all problems. Depending on the depth of problem we may want to choose a heuristic that provides optimal solutions and achieves the lowest time and space which is different for the three problems explored here.

Ignore preconditions is a heuristic that adds edges (actions) to the graph in an attempt to make it easier to find a path between the initial and the goal state. This is accomplish by dropping the conditions on a state and assuming that all actions are permissible. Even though this is an instance of the set covering problem that is NP-hard problem a greedy solution returns a set of logN size where N is the number of literals in the goal, there's no guarantee of admissibility though[1], [6]. Level sum assumes subgoal independence (otherwise inadmissible) and returns the sum of level costs of goals. To calculate the cost we need to sum the values of the first appearance of each goal that is more expensive than counting the number of goal states minus the non-overlapping clauses[1].
